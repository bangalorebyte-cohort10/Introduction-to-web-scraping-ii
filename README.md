**Scraping Assignment for Weekend**

Box Office Mojo has historical data for Studio box office performance since 2000 (Here: http://www.boxofficemojo.com/studio/)
You need to scrape the tabular data for each each since 2000 using Beautiful Soup AND Selenium - these should be two seperate .py files- and write it to a CSV. So there should be two CSV's titled Box_office_bs4.csv and Box_office_selenium.csv which have the exact same data.
